        "abstract": "Loneliness and social isolation are serious and widespread problems among older people, affecting their physical and mental health, quality of life, and longevity. In this paper, we propose a ChatGPT-based conversational companion system for elderly people. The system is designed to provide companionship and help reduce feelings of loneliness and social isolation. The system was evaluated with a preliminary study. The results showed that the system was able to generate responses that were relevant to the created elderly personas. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of ChatGPT, such as potential biases and misinformation, and to consider the ethical implications of using AI-based companionship for the elderly, including privacy concerns.",

The robot\u2019s response also increases its perceived human character traits. We find REC to be moderated by music listening habits, such that social listeners were more affected by the robot\u2019s response. Study\u00a0II ( n  91 ), examining video watching companionship supports these findings, demonstrating that social video viewers enjoy the experience more with the robot present, while habitually solitary viewers do not. Also in line with Study\u00a0I, the robot\u2019s response to the video clip causes people to attribute more positive human character traits to the robot. This has implications for robots as companions for digital media consumption, but also suggests design implications based on REC for other shared experiences with personal robots.",

Considering that AI companions can be beneficial for individuals seeking companionships or relationships, the social and relational aspects of an AI companion are important to investigate. To understand people's perceptions of an AI companion, this study examines the roles of social presence and warmth of an AI companion through an online experiment. Primary findings indicate that social presence of a disembodied AI companion fosters greater perceived usefulness of the AI companion and willingness to recommend the AI companion for lonely individuals. Collectively, the study highlights the importance of social presence for disembodied AI companions.",

        "abstract": "The trend of incorporating assistive conversational agents into people's lives has followed the unprecedented expansion in the usage of artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon, in particular, has been a key trendsetter in this area through its Alexa\u2010powered devices. Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant (IPA) that performs tasks, such as playing music, providing news and information, and controlling smart home appliances. While this IPA is widely utilized, it is especially gaining attention and growing usage by people with special needs. Even though the importance of the utilization of AI by people with special needs has been widely acknowledged in the extant literature, a sizeable gap exists in the marketing literature in relation to the assessment of the managerial and societal implications of IPAs when used by people with special needs. Accordingly, this study aims to examine (a) the stages of relationship development between Alexa and consumers with special needs, and (b) the potential opportunity of this relationship for Amazon in relation to their corporate image. The findings indicate that a relationship between Alexa and consumers with special needs is established as it helps them regain their independence and freedom. This relationship provides an opportunity for Amazon in enhancing its overall image for providing solutions to facilitate the lives of people with special needs.",

A total of 233,914 English tweets were analyzed using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling algorithm to answer the question \"what can ChatGPT do?\". The results revealed three general topics: news, technology, and reactions. The author also identified five functional domains: creative writing, essay writing, prompt writing, code writing, and answering questions. The analysis also found that ChatGPT has the potential to impact technologies and humans in both positive and negative ways. In conclusion, the author outlines four key issues that need to be addressed as a result of this AI advancement: the evolution of jobs, a new technological landscape, the quest for artificial general intelligence, and the progress-ethics conundrum.",

One recent phenomenon is ChatGPT, a chatbot with a conversational artificial intelligence interface that was developed by OpenAI. As one of the most advanced artificial intelligence applications, ChatGPT has drawn much public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines ChatGPT in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously using ChatGPT in educational settings. The second stage of the study examines the case of ChatGPT through lenses of educational transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion, and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of ChatGPT, privacy misleading, and manipulation. The findings of this study provide several research directions that should be considered to ensure a safe and responsible adoption of chatbots, specifically ChatGPT, in education.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has attracted wide attention from the computational linguistics community. Many prior studies have shown that ChatGPT achieves remarkable performance on various NLP tasks in terms of automatic evaluation metrics. However, the ability of ChatGPT to serve as an evaluation metric is still underexplored. Considering assessing the quality of natural language generation (NLG) models is an arduous task and NLG metrics notoriously show their poor correlation with human judgments, we wonder whether ChatGPT is a good NLG evaluation metric. In this report, we provide a preliminary meta-evaluation on ChatGPT to show its reliability as an NLG metric. In detail, we regard ChatGPT as a human evaluator and give task-specific (e.g., summarization) and aspect-specific (e.g., relevance) instruction to prompt ChatGPT to evaluate the generated results of NLG models. We conduct experiments on five NLG meta-evaluation datasets (including summarization, story generation and data-to-text tasks). Experimental results show that compared with previous automatic metrics, ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art or competitive correlation with human judgments in most cases. In addition, we find that the effectiveness of the ChatGPT evaluator might be influenced by the creation method of the meta-evaluation datasets. For the meta-evaluation datasets which are created greatly depending on the reference and thus are biased, the ChatGPT evaluator might lose its effectiveness. We hope our preliminary study could prompt the emergence of a general-purposed reliable NLG metric.",
